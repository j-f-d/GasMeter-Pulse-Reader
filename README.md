# GasMeter Pulse Reader

This schematic and PCB layout will allow you to build, read, tally and report on a standard Pulse-Type Gas and Water Meters. Each trigger event consists of 10L of Gas consumed. This device has been confirmed compatible with the following meters:

* Gameco Model 750 Gas Meter (10L/impulse)

This project was forked from MakerMeik's Gasmeter_with_reed project and has been updated to be completely self-contained, self-powered (or direct powered) and has hardware debounce using a Schmitt trigger.

Here you will find all the files you need to build ESP-01 microcontroller and a reed switch to read your Krom-Schr√∂der gas meter electronically.
